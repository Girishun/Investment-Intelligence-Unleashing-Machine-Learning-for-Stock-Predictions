# Smart Invest: AI-Driven Stock Prediction & Personalized Recommendations
This project aims to provide investment recommendations based on historical stock data and predictive modeling. The system processes data from your Zerodha account, performs extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and builds an investment recommendation system to suggest stocks for immediate purchase and future sale.

## Project Overview
### Data Collection and Processing:
  * Initial Data: The project starts with an XLSX file containing your holding data downloaded from Zerodha.
  * Data Cleaning and Processing: The file is cleaned and processed to remove any inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
  * Stock Grouping and Market Cap Check: Stocks are grouped, and their market capitalizations are verified.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Deep EDA is performed to understand the stock data, including market trends and stock performance metrics.

### Investment Recommendation System:
Machine Learning Component: Predictive modeling and recommendation algorithms are used to suggest investment options.
Techniques:
  * Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning models to predict future stock returns.
  * Recommendation Algorithms: Implementing collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches for personalized recommendations.
  * Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns in stock data using techniques such as Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, or statistical methods.

### Recommendations:
  * Buy Now: The system recommends stocks to purchase immediately.
  * Sell After 3 Months: The system identifies stocks to hold and sell after approximately three months.
  * Least Return: The system flags stocks with the least expected returns to avoid.

### Visualization and Metrics:
  * Returns: Both numeric and graphical representations of stock returns are provided.
  * Performance Metrics: The accuracy and effectiveness of the model are evaluated and captured.

### Technologies Used
  * Data Processing: Python, Pandas, NumPy
  * Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Anomaly Detection
  * Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
  * APIs: Data collection via financial APIs
